# Sales-Optimization-SQL-Project**-
-----------------------------------
📄**Project Description**
-----------------------------
The Sales Optimization Project is a full-cycle SQL analytics initiative that turns raw Orders and Returns data into actionable insights.
By blending customer, product, geographic, and return information, the project pinpoints:

-> which customer segments and regions drive sustainable profit,

-> where shipping choices boost—or erode—margin,

-> which products deliver high revenue but low profit, and

-> how returns translate into direct financial losses.

-----------------------------------

🎯 Project Objectives
**#	Strategic Question**
---------------------------
**A. Customer Behavior**

--**Focus marketing spend on the most lucrative segment × shipping combinations**

1 ) Average profit by segment & region

2 ) Preferred shipping modes of high-profit segments & their impact

3 ) Top-performing segments by purchase frequency & AOV	Focus 

**B. Product Performance**

--**Optimize pricing, discounting, and inventory for regional and product lines**

1 ) Regions with high sales but poor profit yield

2 ) 3-order moving-average profit by region

3 ) Rank sub-categories by profit within each category

4 ) Year-over-year sales growth per region

5 ) Profit-to-sales ratio per product	

**C. Return Analysis**

--**Reduce return-related losses through quality controls and policy tweaks**

1 ) Products with highest return rates (getreturnrate() SP)

2 ) Total lost sales & profit from returns

3 ) Return rate by category/sub-category

🗂️ **Dataset Overview**
--------------------------
# Table	Rows × Cols	Key Fields	Notes
**orders** --- Order_ID (PK), Product_ID, Customer_ID	After import, dates are cleaned (Order_Date → new_order_date), numeric types are enforced, 
                      and a composite business key (Region + Segment + Product) can be derived for advanced slicing.

**return** --- Order_ID (FK)	Contains only orders that were returned. Inner joins with orders flag financial impact.
